# Face Detector

This repository contains code for a face detection application. The application uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in images and videos.

## Features

- Face detection: The application can detect faces in images and videos using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Face recognition: It can also recognize faces by comparing them with a pre-trained set of known faces.
- Real-time detection: The application can perform face detection in real-time using a webcam or other video input devices.
- Multiple face detection: It can detect multiple faces in an image or video simultaneously.

## Installation

To use the face detector application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shriram-11/Face_Detector.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to detect and recognize faces in images and videos. Here are some examples:

- Detect faces in an image: `python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg`
- Detect faces in a video: `python main.py --video path/to/video.mp4`
- Recognize faces in an image: `python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg --recognize`
- Real-time face detection: `python main.py --realtime`

For more information on how to use the application and its various options, refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md).
